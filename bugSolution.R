```R
# This corrected code shows how to correctly subset a data frame using character vector indexing.

df <- data.frame(col1 = c(1, 2, 3), col2 = c("a", "b", "c"))

# Correct way to subset:
correct_subset <- df["col1"]

# Print the correct subset
print(correct_subset)

#Another way to subset is using the $ operator:
correct_subset2 <- df$col1

# Print the correct subset
print(correct_subset2)
```
